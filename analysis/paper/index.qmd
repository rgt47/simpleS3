# Introduction



If you, like me, feel its time to expand your  R programming armamentarium  to
include  S3 methods. This blog may help. 

Where to start?

In this post we'll walk through an example of a simple "table 1" function using
S3 methods.

We'll start with the 'raw' data from a sample of the Penguins data set and
return a dataframe with summary measures.


S3 methods allow coders to write functions that perform differently for
different classes of objects.

In our project we want to build a function that creates a row in the 'Table 1'
table for each variable in the formula regardless of the class of the variable.

```{r}
library(pacman)
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(knitr)
# source("~/shr/zz.tools.R")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = T)
set.seed(101)
dat <- palmerpenguins::penguins %>%
  filter(!is.na(sex))
```
